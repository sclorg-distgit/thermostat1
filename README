Package %{scl_name} provides Thermostat monitoring and instrumentation tool delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name} collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working Thermostat monitoring and instrumentation tool.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'thermostat'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

Thermostat is a monitoring and instrumentation tool for the Hotspot JVM,
with support for monitoring multiple JVM instances. The system is made
up of two processes: an Agent, which collects data, and a Client which
allows users to visualize this data. These components communicate via
a MongoDB-based storage layer. A pluggable agent and gui framework
allows for collection and visualization of performance data beyond that
which is included out of the box.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located
under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'thermostat'
  Run thermostat from the %{scl_name} software collection.

service thermostat1-thermostat-tomcat start
  Start tomcat on port 8080 and deploy thermostat-webapp

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man thermostat'
  Show man pages for the thermostat command, which is a part of the
  %{scl_name} software collection.
